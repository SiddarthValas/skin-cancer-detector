# Skin Cancer Detection 

A deep learning-powered web application built with Keras, Streamlit, and Ngrok to detect Skin Cancer from skin lesion images. This tool enables real-time prediction of whether an uploaded image shows signs of cancer or not.

## Features

- Upload skin lesion images (JPG, JPEG, PNG)  
= CNN-based prediction: Cancer or Non-Cancer  
= Confidence score display  
= Web-based interface via Streamlit  
= Public URL generation using Ngrok  
= Compatible with Google Colab and local development

##  Model Architecture

The model is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained using Keras:

- Input shape: 224x224 RGB images  
- Layers:
  - Convolution + MaxPooling
  - Dropout + BatchNormalization
  - Dense + Sigmoid Output
- Binary classification: Cancer vs Non-Cancer
